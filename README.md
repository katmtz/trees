# trees and trees and trees and ... and trees
###############################################
a python script that recursively generates "trees" and outputs DXF files that can be cut by a laser cutter

How to Run
################################
> python trees.py <side>

Side can be either 'A' or 'B'. The two sides interlock when printed to make one large, standing tree.
Note that this program does not attempt to make perfectly balanced trees every time, it simply runs
recursively and leaves the "ideal" tree shape to be determined by the user.
